title: Set Up Multiple Organizations
description: Install a CAO control plane across organizations using enterprise-owned private GitHub Apps.
---

For non-public targets, reuse approved enterprise-owned private Apps within one
enterprise, or create them with the required approval and install them separately
on every enrolled organization. A permitted [owner-scoped PAT setup](setup-fine-grained-pat.md)
is another option. Public-only monitoring needs no automation App/PAT.
See [setup combinations](setup-compatibility.md) for visibility and role boundaries,
including GitHub Enterprise Cloud data residency on `*.ghe.com`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Permission does not authorize setup. A coding agent must ask before creating or reusing the control repository, installing the extension/runtime, creating either App, storing variables or secrets, committing, or pushing.

## Install

Complete [Step 1 of Set Up CAO](setup-quickstarts.md#step-1---install-cao):
install the extension and enter a clean default-branch control checkout.
That guide covers creating versus cloning the repository and the
[SAML installer fallback](cao-cli.md#control-plane-installer).
Prepare the approved App pair below before running guided setup.

```bash
CONTROL_REPO="platform/central-agentic-ops"
TARGET_REPO="acme/example-service"
```

## Create and Install the Apps

In enterprise settings:

1. Create one private read App and one private write App.
2. Use the [CAO permission matrix](authentication.md#permissions).
3. Install each App separately on every enrolled organization.
4. Choose **Only select repositories** for every installation.
5. Record both client IDs and download one private key for each App.

Enterprise ownership alone grants no repository access.

## Configure the Control Repository

From the control checkout:

```bash
gh cao setup
```

At **Repositories**, enter the exact value of `$TARGET_REPO`; the control
repository stays included. Choose **`enterprise-app`** when prompted.
Guided setup accepts the approved App client IDs and prompts securely for keys.
Verify independently that all selected organizations belong to the same
enterprise and that both Apps have the required selected-repository
installations. The legacy `enterprise-app` path stores credentials; it does not
prove enterprise membership or installation reach. Prefer
[verified approved-App reuse](authentication.md#reuse-approved-apps) when
connecting existing Apps.
Setup prepares Activity, Dashboard, validation, shared runtime and missing
baseline policy, then configures scoped authentication and Pages.
A private repository does not guarantee private Pages: require restricted
access for non-public evidence and decline public publication otherwise.

For credential-only changes after setup, inspect a dry run before applying:

```bash
gh cao setup auth enterprise-app \
  --repo "$CONTROL_REPO" \
  --read-client-id "<read-app-client-id>" \
  --write-client-id "<write-app-client-id>" \
  --policy .github/workflows/cao.json \
  --write-repository "$CONTROL_REPO" \
  --dry-run

gh cao setup auth enterprise-app \
  --repo "$CONTROL_REPO" \
  --read-client-id "<read-app-client-id>" \
  --write-client-id "<write-app-client-id>" \
  --policy .github/workflows/cao.json \
  --write-repository "$CONTROL_REPO"
```

Paste private keys only into the secure prompts.

The read App must cover the control repository and every exact repository in
the policy. The write App must cover the control repository for review output;
repeat `--write-repository` only for additional approved output repositories.
Ensure every dispatched worker admits the write App's `APP-SLUG[bot]` login.

## Validate and Commit

```bash
gh cao doctor
gh aw doctor --repo "$CONTROL_REPO" --dir .
git diff --check
```

Follow [Publish and open your dashboard](setup-quickstarts.md#step-3---publish-and-open-your-dashboard).
Guided publication requires separate approval; declining or unattended setup
leaves files local. Review and stage only CAO files, never unrelated changes or
secrets. Publication is not proof that collection or deployment has completed.

If an App installation or exact repository selection is missing, correct the
installation instead of widening policy. Before live activation, complete the
current-revision dashboard, review, and live checks in
[Validate before activation](control-plane-authentication.md#validate-before-activation).

## Next: Add a Campaign

Campaign selection, installation, enablement, and the first review run are a separate change. Use [Browse campaigns](catalog.md) or ask an agent to follow `skills/add-cao-campaign/SKILL.md`.
