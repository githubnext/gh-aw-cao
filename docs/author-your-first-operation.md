title: Build Your First Campaign
description: Define one repository outcome, generate the workflows, and prove the campaign in review mode.
---

Build a campaign only when the [catalog](catalog.md) does not already produce the outcome you need.

A campaign has:

- one **orchestrator** that selects eligible repositories;
- one or more **workers** that each handle one selected repository;
- one measurable **outcome** that defines success.

This guide creates a review-ready campaign. Production rollout comes later.

## Before You Start

Complete the [quickstart](getting-started.md) so you have a proven control repository and one low-risk test repository. Use a private control repository when the target or required evidence is non-public.

You also need GitHub Agentic Workflows `v0.89.22` or newer:

```bash
gh aw version
```

## 1. Write the Campaign Contract

Answer four questions before writing a workflow:

| Question | Example |
| --- | --- |
| What should improve? | Repositories should stop using an unsupported Node.js version. |
| Which repositories qualify? | A checked-in engine range includes the unsupported version. |
| What output is needed? | A pull request that updates the range and CI matrix. |
| When should nothing happen? | The repository is already supported, a matching PR exists, or evidence is incomplete. |

Keep the outcome to one sentence. If it needs unrelated outputs or success measures, split it.

## 2. Generate the Campaign

Open the CAO source or control repository in a coding agent and use:

```text
Read and follow skills/create-cao-campaign/SKILL.md.

Outcome:
[What should measurably improve?]

Eligibility:
[What evidence makes a repository a candidate?]

Safe output:
[What is the smallest useful output?]

No-op cases:
[When should the campaign create nothing?]

Use [OWNER/REPOSITORY] for the first proof. Keep it in review mode, limit it to
one repository, and do not change the target. Compile the workflows and report
the changed files, validation results, and first-run command.
```

Do not copy or edit a generated `.lock.yml` file. The skill creates editable workflow Markdown and compiles it.

## 3. Review What Was Generated

Expect:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `<campaign>/aw.yml` | Installable campaign manifest |
| `<campaign>/README.md` | Campaign purpose, setup, and behavior |
| `.github/workflows/<campaign>.md` | Orchestrator |
| `.github/workflows/<campaign>-<worker>.md` | One focused worker per task |
| `.github/workflows/cao.json` | Campaign and worker registration |

Before running, confirm:

- agent tools are read-only;
- safe outputs are minimal and explicit;
- every worker receives exactly one repository;
- duplicate, healthy, and insufficient-evidence cases return `noop`;
- mode is `review` and the repository limit is one.

## 4. Compile and Test

In this catalog repository:

```bash
npm run compile:locks
npm run compile
npm test
git diff --check
```

In another repository:

```bash
gh aw compile --strict --schedule-seed OWNER/REPOSITORY
```

Review generated lock-file changes for unexpected permissions, secrets, network hosts, write destinations, or worker dispatches.

## 5. Prove One Review Run

Commit the source, generated locks, manifest, runtime resources, and policy together. Then run only the orchestrator:

```bash
gh aw run <campaign> --ref <default-branch> \
  --raw-field target_repo="OWNER/REPOSITORY" \
  --raw-field max_repos="1" \
  --raw-field rollout_percent="100" \
  --raw-field safe_output_mode="review"
```

The proof passes when exactly one authorized repository was selected, only expected workers ran, output stayed in the private review destination, and the target did not change. A useful review item or an explainable `noop` are both valid.

Do not promote the campaign to `live` during this first authoring session.

## Keep It Private or Propose It

A campaign can remain in its control repository. To propose it for the official catalog, open a pull request with its manifest, README, workflow sources, generated locks, policy registration, and focused contract tests.

The catalog is curated. Publication does not grant rollout authority in another control repository.
