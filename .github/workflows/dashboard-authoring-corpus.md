# Dashboard Authoring Corpus

Grow the generate-dashboard-ir skill's corpus by one validated example. Use the installed `dashboard-authoring` skill to define the workflow intent and operational-value contract, then use the installed `generate-dashboard-ir` skill for corpus creation and Dashboard Language generation. Treat the Dashboard Language specification and validator as authoritative.

## Context

- Repository: `${{ github.repository }}`
- Optional focus: `${{ inputs.focus }}`
- Intent skill: `.github/skills/dashboard-authoring/SKILL.md`
- Dashboard IR skill: `.github/skills/generate-dashboard-ir/SKILL.md`
- Corpus index: `.github/skills/generate-dashboard-ir/corpus/index.json`
- Specification: `docs/dashboard-language-specification.md`
- Validator: `dashboard/site/src/validator.js`

## Synthesize one task

Read the corpus index and metadata before choosing a candidate. Synthesize exactly one realistic, bounded agentic-workflow task for a repository operator. Use the optional focus when provided. The task must have a clear actor, subject, activation evidence, required effect, no-op conditions, and success conditions.

Reject a candidate whose intent, opportunity, attainment metric, or dashboard composition materially duplicates an indexed example. Call `noop` with the duplicate IDs when no novel candidate remains.

Do not create an executable workflow, grader, fabricated run, or fabricated evidence. This feature produces design examples only.

## Infer operational value

Infer a design-time contract from the task's intent. Bind each hypothetical run to a stable opportunity, enumerate accepted repository evidence and repositories, select exactly one direct metric in `[0,1]`, and define maturation, zero, and missing-evidence rules.

Use an attainment-only baseline with null value and cutoff. Synthetic tasks have no immutable pre-adoption evidence for a comparable baseline.

## Infer the dashboard

Use the installed `generate-dashboard-ir` skill with the synthetic task and operational-value contract as the user intent, plus the specification and validator from Context. Scope every view to the synthetic workflow with a `workflow` filter. Include only views that help an operator understand activation, execution, required effects, actionable exceptions, or operational-value attainment.

## Validate and publish

Add one metadata/dashboard pair and update the sorted corpus index exactly as the skill requires. Run:

```text
npm --prefix dashboard/site run validate:corpus
```

If validation fails, repair the candidate and rerun it. Do not create a pull request unless validation passes. Use `create-pull-request` for exactly the new pair and index update. In the pull request body, summarize the synthetic task, value contract, selected views, duplicate check, and successful validation command.

Call `noop` when there is no novel candidate, required vocabulary cannot express the dashboard without invention, or validation cannot pass within the run.
