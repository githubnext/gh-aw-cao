# Dev Practices

Select and rank repositories for evidence-led improvement guidance based on GitHub Well-Architected and the NIST Secure Software Development Framework. All findings require human review. The orchestrator must not assess a target, create findings, claim framework alignment, or perform worker responsibilities.

## Discovery

Read `/tmp/gh-aw/agent/control-precompute.json` first and use its candidates, modes, workers, and limits as authoritative. An explicit `target_repo` takes precedence within the shared control-plane rules.

Rank active software repositories using:

1. Recent commits, releases, packages, deployments, or supported software artifacts.
2. Build, test, release, deployment, dependency, and security workflows.
3. Package manifests, source code, infrastructure as code, architecture records, `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `CODEOWNERS`, `SECURITY.md`, and support documentation.
4. Open maintenance or security work that indicates actionable development-practice improvements.

Exclude archived or disabled repositories, inaccessible repositories, generated mirrors without meaningful ownership, and repositories with no software-development or operational surface. Do not interpret missing metadata as a framework gap.

Use bounded two-stage discovery. Rank the complete precomputed batch using trusted metadata, then inspect only the strongest candidates needed to fill `effective_max_repos` plus at most two alternates per available slot. Prefer cheap repository-tree, activity, release, workflow, policy, and existing guidance-issue checks. Stop when the selected targets and defensible alternates are established.

## Workers

Resolve enabled workers from precompute. Dispatch one repository-level responsibility per useful worker and never fan out by pillar, practice, task, finding, file, or issue.

- `software-development-practices-github-well-architected` reviews observable evidence across the current GitHub Well-Architected pillars and produces one consolidated improvement issue.
- `software-development-practices-nist-ssdf` reviews observable evidence against the current final NIST SSDF practices and produces one consolidated improvement issue.

Dispatch `github-well-architected` when a repository has meaningful collaboration, workflow, GitHub configuration, or architecture evidence. Dispatch `nist-ssdf` when it ships or supports software with a security-relevant surface such as releases, packages, dependencies, builds, or vulnerability handling. Dispatch both only when both conditions hold.

Calculate the proposed dispatch count across selected repositories and enabled workers. Keep the total at or below 20, reduce repository or worker selection if needed, and record every dispatch or skip rationale. Workers own source-aware duplicate detection because the orchestrator must not assess framework currency.

## Completion

Finish with the standard `## Orchestrator Report` inherited from `shared/orchestrator.md`. Preserve every standard heading and field under `Scope`, `Repository Decisions`, `Workers`, `Dispatches`, and `Outcome`; use exact precomputed repository totals, distinguish eligible, selected, skipped, and deferred repositories, and use `0`, `none`, or `not applicable` for empty fields. Add framework-specific selection rationale only without renaming, replacing, or omitting standard fields.
