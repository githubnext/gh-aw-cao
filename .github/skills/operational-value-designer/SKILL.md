# Operational Value Grader

Design one deterministic `operational-value` grader that reports absolute operational attainment for each workflow run.

Operational value is the degree to which the workflow's intended repository outcome is attained for the opportunity assigned to a run, demonstrated by accepted repository evidence under a frozen contract. It is not execution quality, output volume, safe-output creation, or an agent's assessment.

## Output

Create one executable evaluator at:

```text
.github/aw/PACKAGE/graders/WORKFLOW-NAME-operational-value.sh
```

Configure the workflow:

```yaml
graders:
  operational-value:
    run: .github/aw/PACKAGE/graders/WORKFLOW-NAME-operational-value.sh
```

The grader's primary operational value (`value`) is absolute attainment in `[0,1]`. A comparable frozen baseline may be reported separately as `baselineValue`; gh-aw derives `deltaFromBaseline`. Never define the primary operational value as a difference from baseline.

## Design Procedure

1. Validate `OWNER/REPO` and resolve `.github/workflows/WORKFLOW-NAME.md`. Do not infer inputs from the workspace or remotes.
2. Recover adoption-time intent from the workflow's first commit and first parent. Use only adoption-time workflow content and pre-adoption evidence to choose opportunities, accepted evidence, formulas, targets, or a baseline.
3. Define how every workflow run binds to one operational case:
   - produce a stable `opportunityKey`;
   - prevent overlapping ownership where possible;
   - preserve repeated keys when duplicate runs target the same opportunity so downstream analysis can cluster or deduplicate them;
   - treat reruns with the same GitHub run ID as the same subject.
4. Freeze accepted evidence, evidence repositories, matching rules, zero-versus-missing behavior, and `maturesAt` computation.
   - Declare only the workflow permission scopes required to collect that evidence. The evaluator receives `GH_TOKEN` with the agent job's declared permissions; gh-aw does not add evidence permissions automatically.
5. Choose exactly one direct primary metric in `[0,1]`. Higher must always mean greater attainment. Keep trace graders and activity counts separate.
6. If comparable pre-adoption evidence exists, score it with the same metric and freeze it under `baseline`. Otherwise use `attainment-only` with a null baseline value.
7. Implement the evaluator interface below and run:

   ```bash
   .github/skills/operational-value-designer/scripts/verify-operational-value-evaluator.sh .github/aw/PACKAGE/graders/WORKFLOW-NAME-operational-value.sh
   gh aw compile .github/workflows/WORKFLOW-NAME.md
   ```
8. For a packaged workflow, declare the evaluator's `.github/aw/PACKAGE/graders/` source and destination in the package manifest, then install into a clean consumer and confirm it exists at the registered path before declaring the grader distributable.

## Evaluator Interface

The evaluator uses Bash 3.2-compatible Bash plus `jq` and supports:

- `--definition`: print the frozen schema-version 4 contract.
- `--metric`: read one evidence object on stdin and print a deterministic number in `[0,1]` or `null`.
- `--grade-run`: read a run request on stdin and print one operational-value observation.

`--grade-run` receives a schema-version 1 request containing the complete `run` subject, `evidenceAt`, an optional replay `case`, the workflow `event`, and grader `config`. It returns `value`, `opportunityKey`, replayable `case`, `evidenceCutoff`, `maturesAt`, `provenance`, and optional diagnostics.

The function must cap `evidenceCutoff` at the earlier of `evidenceAt` and `maturesAt`. A run is never intrinsically pending: the operational value is an as-of observation and may be recomputed until maturity. After maturity, the cap makes the result stable.

## Regrade a Historical Run

Recompute a run at an explicit evidence time with the same evaluator used by the original run:

```bash
gh aw graders operational-value RUN-ID \
  --evidence-at 2026-08-30T12:00:00.000Z \
  --json
```

Add `--repo [HOST/]OWNER/REPO` to select the GitHub host for the current repository checkout. The command verifies the archived evaluator against both digest records and the evaluator at the recorded commit before executing it.

## Definition Contract

`--definition` must contain:

- `schemaVersion: 4` and `grader: "operational-value"`;
- repository, workflow name, source path, and adoption commit/time;
- operational-value statement;
- evidence opportunity, assignment, accepted evidence, repositories, collection, maturation, zero rule, and missing rule;
- one primary metric with formula and validation examples;
- baseline mode, value, cutoff, and provenance.

For `baseline-comparable`, baseline value must be in `[0,1]` and have immutable provenance. For `attainment-only`, baseline value and cutoff must be null.

## Interpretation Rules

- `value` answers "what operational value did this run attain for its assigned opportunity?"
- `deltaFromBaseline` answers "how far is this observation above or below the frozen pre-adoption reference?"
- Neither establishes that the workflow caused the outcome.
- Compare runs only under the same evaluator digest and evidence horizon.
- Identify a replayed observation by `(runId, evaluatorDigest, evidenceAt)`.
- Do not treat repeated observations of one run, duplicate opportunity keys, or overlapping state windows as independent samples.
